Long-Term
=========

* Rewrite Type::Tiny::Manual.

* Resolve RT#102457. Error::TypeTiny::Assertion needs a better way of
  identifying which stack frame to report the error at, or Type::Params
  needs to mark its compiled subs more clearly.

* Resolve RT#120226 if HAARG will help me flesh out an API.
